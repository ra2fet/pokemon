# Pokemon

A new Flutter project  I have implemented the Flutter Clean Architecture, a software design approach championed by Uncle Bob. 
The project comprises four main screens: 
* Splash Screen.
* Home Screen.
* Animations Screen.
* Pokemon Screen.

To effectively manage the application's state, I used both Bloc and Cubit, two well-known state management solutions. I haven't used routing package since it is not a big project. I have implemented load more feature in pokemon page as an additional feature.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
